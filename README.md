I'd be glad to create a comprehensive README file for your GitHub project, incorporating the best aspects of the provided responses and addressing potential shortcomings:

# TechTree

TechTree is designed to facilitate the display and management of courses based on student selections. The platform provides a user-friendly interface where students can explore and choose from a variety of courses tailored to their preferences and requirements. Additionally, administrators have the capability to manage course links, ensuring that the course offerings are up-to-date and accurately represented. This system enhances the learning experience by allowing personalized course recommendations and streamlined administrative control.

## Understanding the Code

Understanding the Code
The project is organized into several layers, each representing a logical component of the system:
TechTree.BLL: Contains the business logic of the application.
TechTree.DAL: Handles data access and database interactions.
TechTree.PresentationLayer: Manages the user interface and user interactions.

## Key Components
Student class: Stores student information (ID, name, etc.).
Course class: Defines a course with properties such as title, description, and link.
Admin class: Manages course links and ensures the course offerings are updated.
CourseSelection class: Handles the logic for displaying courses based on student selections.
Program class: The entry point demonstrating how to create and use the TechTree objects.
